# Linux EDR System

## Overview

This project is a Python-based Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system for Linux. It uses a combination of rule-based detection and machine learning (ML) to identify and mitigate security threats in real-time. The system monitors user behavior and processes, detects potential threats, and can automatically quarantine malicious files or terminate harmful processes.

### Features

- **Real-Time Process Monitoring:** Continuously monitors active processes for suspicious behavior.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Utilizes user behavior analysis to detect anomalies.
- **Machine Learning Threat Detection:** Incorporates an ML model to enhance threat detection accuracy.
- **Automatic Quarantine:** Isolates potentially malicious files and terminates dangerous processes.
- **Alert System:** Sends alerts to administrators when suspicious activities are detected.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for easier debugging and auditing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Linux environment
- Basic knowledge of Python

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linux-edr-system.git
   cd linux-edr-system
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the environment:**
   Ensure that the necessary directories for quarantine and logs exist:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/quarantine
   sudo mkdir -p /var/log/edr_system
   sudo chmod -R 700 /var/quarantine /var/log/edr_system
   ```

4. **Configure the logging and quarantine directories (optional):**
   Adjust paths in `utils/logger.py` and `quarantine.py` if needed.

## Usage

### Running the EDR System

To start the EDR system:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will start monitoring processes in real-time. Any detected threats will be logged, and alerts will be sent out.

### Logs and Alerts

- **Logs** are stored in `/var/log/edr_system/edr.log`.
- **Alerts** are sent to the administrator via email. Ensure your SMTP server is configured correctly.

### Quarantine

Files and executables that are deemed suspicious are moved to `/var/quarantine`. Review these files periodically to determine if they are false positives.

## Configuration

### Adjusting Detection Thresholds

The threshold for detecting suspicious behavior is defined in `analysis.py`. You can adjust the `command_threshold` variable to fine-tune sensitivity:

```python
command_threshold = 10  # Default threshold
```

### Configuring Alerts

Alerts are sent using the SMTP protocol. Update the `alert.py` file to configure the email settings:

```python
msg['From'] = 'edr-system@example.com'
msg['To'] = 'admin@example.com'
```

Replace `example.com` with your domain or SMTP server details.

## Training the ML Model

### Data Collection

To improve the ML model, collect data on benign and malicious behaviors. This can be done by logging user actions and process information over time.

### Model Training

1. Prepare a labeled dataset of features and labels (0 for benign, 1 for malicious).
2. Use the provided `train_model.py` script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python3 train_model.py
   ```
3. The trained model will be saved as `model/threat_detection_model.pkl`. This file is loaded by the EDR system during runtime.

### Notes for Enhancement

- **Advanced Machine Learning:** Consider integrating deep learning models or ensemble methods for better threat detection.
- **Integration with SIEM Tools:** For enterprises, integrating with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools could provide more comprehensive monitoring.
- **User Interface:** Developing a UI for easier management and monitoring could be beneficial.
